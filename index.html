            Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows.
            An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. It allows
            console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode. The user can switch
            between the two using the Alt+â†µ Enter key combination. The text mode is unavailable
            in Windows Vista and later. Starting with Windows 10, however, a native full-screen mode 
            is available.</h1>
